# LITA_Capstone_Project
This project analyzes two datasets using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. SQL is used for querying and data extraction, Excel for data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. The goal is to uncover insights, trends, and key metrics to drive informed decision-making.

## PROJECT 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
### Overview
----------------
This project collects and analyses data from various regions, markets, and stores. The goal is to provide insights into the revenue, units sold, and transaction categories over different periods. The analysis focuses on understanding revenue trends and sales performance across regions and calculating key metrics such as average revenue by region.
### Data Collected
---------------
The dataset includes the following key columns:
1.	ORDER ID: unique identifier for each order placed.
2.	CUSTOMER ID: unique identifier for each customer.
3.	PRODUCT: the specific item sold to a customer.
4.	REGION: the geographical area where the store operates.
5.	ORDER DATE: the date on which a particular sale or transaction was made.
6.	QUANTITY/SALES: the number of units of a product that were sold.
7.	UNIT PRICE: the number of units sold for a given transaction.
8.	REVENUE: the total monetary value generated from the sale.
### Project Objectives
----------------
This project was designed to address the following analysis goals:
- Revenue by region: determine the total revenue generated in each region.
- Total sales by region: analyze the number of quantities sold across different regions to identify the highest selling locations.
- Total sales by product: calculate the total sales made from each product.
- Total sales by month: calculate the total sales made each month on all products.
- Average revenue by region: calculate the average revenue per sale in each region to assess performance.
- Total revenue per year: determine the total revenue generated each year.
### How To Use The Data
---------------
- Revenue by region: group the data by region and sum the revenue column. This provides an overview of how much revenue each region is generating.
- Units sold by region: group the data by region and sum the units sold to identify which regions are moving the most products.
- Average revenue by region: to get the average revenue per transaction or unit sold in a region.
### Formulas Used
---------------
Microsoft Excel
- Revenue = Unitprice * QuantitySold
- Average Revenue = Total Revenue / QuantitySold
